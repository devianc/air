what is this?
=============

air is a fork of WebChat2.0, by Chris Chabot.

This is a comet / ajax chat application, which uses a custom
PHP (5.x) backend daemon that connects to a IRC server.


how do I get it working?
========================

To run this application you need a few things:

1) A IRC server configured to allow many(!) connections from
localhost (or the host where the daemon resides), or, alternatively, WEBIRC support
(at least, I think I added that. It's been ages since I looked at this code.)

During development i've used InspIRCd so if you run into 
trouble, try using that :-)

2) Run the PHP chat daemon, it functions as the gateway between
the browser based javascript frontend, and the irc backend, for
extra paranoia protection, you could run the chat daemon in a 
chroot envirioment, read one of the many FAQ's available on this 

3) A modern browser!
